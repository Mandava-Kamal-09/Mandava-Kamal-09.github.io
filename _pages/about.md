I am a graduate student in **Data Science** at the University of Central Oklahoma with a **Bachelor of Technology in Biotechnology**. My background bridges the gap between life sciences and computational analysis.

I am an **aspiring Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science (Fall 2026)**, passionate about interdisciplinary research at the intersection of:
* **Computer Science** (Agent-Based Modeling, Machine Learning)
* **Applied Mathematics** (Non-linear Dynamics)
* **Computational Physics** (Soft Matter, Biophysics)

My current research focuses on the **Computational Modeling of Fibrinolysis** (blood clot degradation). I am working under the supervision of **[Dr. Brittany Bannish](https://www3.uco.edu/centraldirectory/profiles/828858)** on an NSF-funded project to simulate the stochastic behavior of enzyme diffusion and fiber network collapse.

### 🔬 Current Research Projects

**1. FibriNet (Agent-Based Model)**
Building a computational framework (Python) to model the mechanical and structural properties of fibrin networks under stress.

**2. Deep Learning for Chemical factors affecting Fibrinolysis**
Utilizing **PyTorch** to train Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) on large-scale simulation datasets (2M+ observations) to predict clot lysis times based on chemical constraints.

**3. Statistical Analysis of Clot Dynamics**
Applied regression analysis to identify key chemical factors that inhibit or accelerate the fibrinolysis process.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
