I am a researcher working at the intersection of Applied Mathematics, Biophysics, and Computer Science. My work focuses on developing mechanistic and hybrid AI models to understand complex biological networks.

My research addresses the dynamics of fibrinolytic systems through **FibriNet**, an NSF-funded agent-based framework for modeling fibrinolysis. I architect simulation frameworks that capture the mechanical and structural response of fibrin networks under stress, and leverage High-Performance Computing (HPC) to train neural networks on millions of simulated trials. This approach bridges the gap between mechanistic simulation and clinical data, enabling predictive models of clot degradation from biochemical and kinetic constraints. My work is conducted under the guidance of **[Dr. Brittany Bannish](https://www3.uco.edu/centraldirectory/profiles/828858)** as part of an NSF-funded project.

Methodologically, I integrate discrete event simulation, deep learning (PyTorch), and statistical inference to quantify relationships between network topology, enzyme kinetics, and degradation dynamics.

## Current Focus

**Currently:** Integrating Michaelis–Menten enzyme kinetics into FibriNet to improve predictive accuracy for whole-clot degradation.

**Upcoming:** Presenting "Dynamical Degradation of Fibrin Networks" at Dynamics Days US 2026 in Tucson, AZ.
