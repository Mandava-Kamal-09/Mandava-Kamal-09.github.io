I am developing computational models of stochastic biological systems, using fibrinolysis (blood clot degradation) as a case study in network dynamics and enzyme-mediated processes. My research focuses on stochastic particle systems and nonlinear mechanical behavior, combining agent-based simulation with statistical inference and machine learning.

I build simulation frameworks to model the mechanical and structural response of fibrin networks under stress, and train neural networks on large-scale simulation data to predict Lysis time of a fibrin network from biochemical and kinetic constraints. This work is conducted under the guidance of **[Dr. Brittany Bannish](https://www3.uco.edu/centraldirectory/profiles/828858)** as part of an NSF-funded project. Methodologically, I integrate discrete event simulation, deep learning (PyTorch), and regression analysis to bridge mechanistic modeling with data driven prediction.
