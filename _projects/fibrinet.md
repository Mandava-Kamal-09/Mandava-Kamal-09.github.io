FibriNet is an agent-based computational model that simulates the polymerization and network formation of fibrin fibers—the key structural component of blood clots. The framework models the mechanical and structural properties of fibrin networks under stress using a spring-mass system approach.

## Methodology

The model represents fibrin networks as interconnected nodes connected by springs, allowing simulation of:
- Network collapse under enzymatic attack
- Mechanical response to stress
- Structural degradation during fibrinolysis

This work is part of an NSF-funded project under the supervision of Dr. Brittany Bannish at the University of Central Oklahoma.

## Technical Details

- **Language**: Python
- **Approach**: Agent-based modeling, discrete event simulation
- **Application**: Computational biology, biophysics
