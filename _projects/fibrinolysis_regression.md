---

Multiple linear regression analysis predicting fibrinolysis rates from biochemical kinetic parameters. This project identifies key chemical factors that inhibit or accelerate the clot degradation process.

## Methodology

Applied regression analysis on experimental data to isolate significant variables affecting fibrinolysis dynamics. The analysis informs understanding of biochemical constraints on clot degradation.

## Technical Details

- **Language**: Python
- **Methods**: Multiple linear regression, statistical inference
- **Application**: Computational biology, data analysis
